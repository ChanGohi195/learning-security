# Learning Security

A personal security learning journal documenting my journey from fundamentals to advanced topics.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Understand attacks to learn defense** - Know how things break before learning how to protect them
- **Hints before answers** - Work through problems, don't just memorize solutions
- **Always ask "why is this vulnerable?"** - Understanding root causes, not just symptoms
- **Ethical boundaries** - Attack techniques for defense only, authorized environments only
